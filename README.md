# Hotel-Recommendation-System
- A hotel recommendation system aims to predict which hotel a user is most likely to choose from among all hotels. So to build this type of system which will help the user to book the best hotel out of all the other hotels. We can do this using customer reviews.

- For example, suppose you want to go on a business trip, so the hotel recommendation system should show you the hotels that other customers have rated best for business travel. It is therefore also our approach to build a recommendation system based on customer reviews and ratings.

- The dataset that I am using here is downloaded from Kaggle : [Download](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe/download)
